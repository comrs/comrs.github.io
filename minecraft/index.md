# COMRS Dedicated Minecraft Server
This page shows the current status of our Dedicated Minecraft Server. Downtime often occurs due to limited computing resources. We also prefer playing if theres more than 2 players.

![Server-status](https://mcapi.us/server/image?ip=plus-percentage.gl.at.ply.gg&port=63913&theme=dark&title=)

Java: `plus-percentage.gl.at.ply.gg:63913`

Bedrock: `plus-percentage.gl.at.ply.gg:` 
Port `63913` or [Click Me Instead!](minecraft:?addExternalServer=COMRS|plus-percentage.gl.at.ply.gg:63913) (automatically opens minecraft then go to server section)


Cracked Java clients can join, although Bedrock clients needs Xbox account to join. To join without Xbox account, simply change port to `63914`


Please enjoy your stay!
