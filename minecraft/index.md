# COMRS Dedicated Minecraft Server
This page shows the current status of our Dedicated Minecraft Server. Downtime often occurs due to limited computing resources. We also prefer playing if theres more than 2 players.

![Server-status](https://mcapi.us/server/image?ip=environment-o.craft.ply.gg&port=7927&theme=dark&title=)

Java (1.8.x - 1.12.x): `environment-o.craft.ply.gg`

Java(1.16+) & Bedrock(1.19.80+): `v-turns.at.ply.gg`
Port: `26684`

Bedrock (Unsigned): `children-passage.at.ply.gg` 
Port `59794`

Why so alot? Well, The first IP is for players who has native 1.8 to 1.12 clients. It is highly recommended to use these client version and IP if you want stability. But for whatever reason you still want to use latest client then you are welcome! 
For bedrock players, you would want to use the second IP if you have an Xbox account. If you don't have one then you will need to use the third one. What makes them different? Signed players can make their skin visible to Java players, and their names is automatically added with special prefix such as `*` in order to avoid catastrophic issues when someone joins with same name. 


That being said, please enjoy your stay!
