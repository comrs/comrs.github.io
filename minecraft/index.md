# COMRS Dedicated Minecraft Server
This page shows the current status of our Dedicated Minecraft Server. Downtime often occurs due to limited computing resources. We also prefer playing if theres more than 2 players.

![Server-status](https://mcapi.us/server/image?ip=environment-o.craft.ply.gg&port=7927&theme=dark&title=)

Java: `environment-o.craft.ply.gg`

Bedrock: `children-passage.at.ply.gg` 
Port `59794`

Bedrock players must have `1.19.80+` and above while Java players can play with version 1.20 and below (Also below down to 1.8! Thanks ViaVersion.)
> ~~Note: Bedrock players must login first to Xbox in order to join due to Geyser limitations, workarounds are still in testing. In future this will be removed.~~ Players without account can join now! Enjoy! ;)
