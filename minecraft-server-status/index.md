# COMRS Dedicated Minecraft Server Status
This page shows status of our Dedicated Minecraft Server, since not all the time the server is up due to it running on limited environment.

![Server-status](https://mcapi.us/server/image?ip=environment-o.craft.ply.gg&port=7927&theme=dark&title=)

Java: `environment-o.craft.ply.gg:7927`

Bedrock: `children-passage.at.ply.gg` 
Port `59794`

Bedrock players must have `1.19.50+` and above while Java players can play with versions below 1.19.4 (Thanks ViaVersion.)
> ~~Note: Bedrock players must login first to Xbox in order to join due to Geyser limitations, workarounds are still in testing. In future this will be removed.~~ Players without account can join now! Enjoy! ;)
